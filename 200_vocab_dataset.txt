<SOS> i know that tom ca n't do that as well as i can <EOS>
<SOS> i thought you said that you did n't know how to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't know how to do what mary asked him to do <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew that he could n't speak french as well as mary could <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know why tom does n't want to go with us <EOS>
<SOS> it was tom who told mary she did n't need to do that <EOS>
<SOS> why would you want to go there if you do n't have to <EOS>
<SOS> we ca n't make tom do something he does n't want to do <EOS>

<SOS> i think i 'm going to go see what tom is up to <EOS>
<SOS> if it was n't for you , i would n't be here now <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't have to go there if he did n't want to <EOS>
<SOS> if you did n't want to come , you should 've said something <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm not sure , but i think tom wants to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he did n't really know how to do that very well <EOS>
<SOS> if there 's anything you want to do , you should do it <EOS>
<SOS> tom has a lot of work to do before he can go home <EOS>
<SOS> tom said that it did n't take him so long to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't know who mary was going to go to boston with <EOS>
<SOS> there 's no way tom would 've done what you say he did <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm not sure that you 'll have the time to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i would n't have done that if tom had n't told me to <EOS>
<SOS> you knew tom told mary not to do that , did n't you <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom knows why you want me to do that <EOS>
<SOS> how did you find out that tom did n't need to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he 'd do that for you if you asked him to <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know how tom did that , but he did it <EOS>
<SOS> do you really think that i 'm going to let you do that <EOS>
<SOS> you knew i did n't need to do that , did n't you <EOS>
<SOS> tom told mary about what happened to him when he was in boston <EOS>
<SOS> how much more do we have to do before we can go home <EOS>
<SOS> why do n't you just say you do n't want to do it <EOS>

<SOS> i want a car , but i have no money to buy one <EOS>
<SOS> you do a lot of your work at home , do n't you <EOS>
<SOS> tom wanted to talk to mary , but he could n't find her <EOS>
<SOS> she asked him to stay , but he had to go to work <EOS>
<SOS> you 're going to need more money than that , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't know that tom did n't know how to speak french <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he did n't know who mary wanted to do that with <EOS>
<SOS> how did you know that tom did n't know how to speak french <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't have to do this if you do n't want to <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't want to know why i 'm here , do you <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't need to do that if you do n't want to <EOS>
<SOS> i think it would 've been better if we had n't done that <EOS>
<SOS> if tom does n't want to help , he does n't have to <EOS>
<SOS> how did you find out that tom was the one who did that <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know how tom did it , but he did it <EOS>
<SOS> it 's up to us to make sure tom does n't do that <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't have to tell tom if you do n't want to <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't have to eat it if you do n't want to <EOS>
<SOS> tom told me he 'd do that if i did that , too <EOS>
<SOS> if i do n't do that now , i 'll never do it <EOS>
<SOS> what do you think tom would say if he knew we were here <EOS>
<SOS> tom should tell mary that he does n't want her to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom still does n't know who 's going to help him do that <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think tom will be the next one to do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he did n't think that mary wanted to do that again <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think that this is a good time to do this <EOS>
<SOS> you 're the only one who can do it , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> i have a lot of work to do before i can go home <EOS>
<SOS> the only one here who does n't want to do that is tom <EOS>

<SOS> did you really think that was what tom was going to give mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't know mary should n't be doing what she was doing <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think i 'll have the time to do that today <EOS>
<SOS> you do n't want tom to do that right now , do you <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know how much more time this is going to take <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think this is a good time to talk to tom <EOS>
<SOS> i was n't in the room when tom asked mary to help him <EOS>
<SOS> i think it 's time for me to say what i really think <EOS>
<SOS> i 'm sure that tom is n't going to help mary do that <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he would n't do that , so i asked mary to <EOS>
<SOS> tom said he does n't think that mary really had to do that <EOS>
<SOS> you 're the one that wanted to see me , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> how did you know tom was going to go to boston with mary <EOS>
<SOS> tom knew that mary would never do what she said she 'd do <EOS>
<SOS> tom could n't do that , so he asked mary to help him <EOS>
<SOS> tom asked mary to help him , but she did n't want to <EOS>
<SOS> you 're going to have to work with tom , are n't you <EOS>
<SOS> tom did n't do that the way mary told him to do it <EOS>
<SOS> tom is n't the only one here who knows how to do that <EOS>

<SOS> tom wo n't be going to boston with us , but mary will <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't know how much time you 'll have to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't know tom was going to tell mary what to do <EOS>

<SOS> i want to tell as many people as i can about what happened <EOS>
<SOS> i told tom i would n't do what he asked me to do <EOS>
<SOS> i do n't think i can find the time to do that today <EOS>
<SOS> why ca n't we just tell tom that we ca n't do it <EOS>
<SOS> i really think it would be better not to stay here too long <EOS>
<SOS> if i wanted your help , i would have asked you for it <EOS>
<SOS> you should let tom know that you do n't want to do that <EOS>
<SOS> i did n't let tom know that i knew how to speak french <EOS>
